# Customer Manager with IndexedDB and Tailwind CSS

## Key Features

- **Local Storage:** Utilizes IndexedDB, a browser database, to store and manage customer information efficiently and securely.
  
- **CRUD Operations:** Allows basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customers directly from the user interface.

- **Responsive Design:** Thanks to Tailwind CSS, the UI adapts optimally to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across mobile and desktop devices.

- **Simplified Workflow:** The application offers an intuitive interface that makes customer management easy, with features like editing and deleting records with just a few clicks.

## How to Use

1. **Navigation:** Upon accessing the application, a clear navigation menu is presented from which users can access different sections of the application, such as the customer list and creation of new customers.

2. **Customer Listing:** On the main page, a list of customers stored in the database is displayed, with options to edit or delete each record.

3. **Customer Editing:** Clicking on the edit button next to a customer redirects to a page where details of the selected customer can be updated.

4. **Creating New Customers:** From the customer creation page, users can add information about a new customer and save it to the database for further management.

## Technologies Used

- **IndexedDB:** For data storage in the browser.
  
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and efficient UI design and styling.

- **JavaScript:** For application logic and interaction with the database.

This project provides a simple and effective solution for customer management in web environments, with a focus on ease of use and development efficiency.
